					<h2 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Introduction.</h2>

					<p> {{$appName}} is a fan-focused merchandise and brand platform developed and operated by Velocity Sports Labs Limited, a Ghanaian company (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We operate the {{$appName}} website at {{$appName}}.com (the “Site”), along with related services including mobile interfaces, ordering systems, and other features that power the {{$appName}} shopping experience (collectively, the “Service”).

					</p>

					<p>
						Our mission is to help sports teams, fan communities, and emerging creators unlock value through branded merchandise—bridging identity, culture, and commerce in meaningful ways. By using the Service, you agree to the terms set out below, forming a binding legal agreement between you and Velocity Sports Labs Limited.
					</p>


					<h2 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY.</h2>


					<p>
						By registering for, accessing, or using any part of the Service, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms of Service—including our Privacy Policy and Cancellation & Returns Policy (collectively, the “Terms”).
					</p>

					<p>
						If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Site or any part of the Service. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.
					</p>



					<h2 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">IMPORTANT: DISPUTE RESOLUTION CLAUSE</h2>
					<p>
						These Terms contain a binding arbitration clause for users outside of jurisdictions like the UK or EU. This means that in the event of a dispute between you and {{$appName}} (Velocity Sports Labs Limited), we agree to resolve it through private arbitration rather than court proceedings (except where otherwise allowed by law or small claims court).
					</p>

					<p>
						You also agree not to bring or join class actions or jury trials. Please read Section 18 for full details of the arbitration terms.
					</p>

					<!-- <p>
						1.3 This policy forms part of our broader <nuxt-link :to="{name: 'terms'}" class="underline text-primary font-medium">Terms & Conditions</nuxt-link> and should be read alongside them. Any terms not defined here carry the same meaning as in the Terms & Conditions.
					</p>

					<p>
